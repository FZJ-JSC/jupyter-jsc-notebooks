An extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the
Jupyter Notebook and Architecture.  [Currently in beta.](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906)

[JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the next-generation user interface for [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org). It offers
all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook,
terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and
powerful user inteface.
Eventually, JupyterLab will replace the classic Jupyter Notebook after
JupyterLab reaches 1.0.

JupyterLab can be extended using extensions that are [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages
and use our public APIs. You can search for the GitHub topic [jupyterlab-extension](https://github.com/topics/jupyterlab-extension) to find extensions. To learn more about extensions, see our  [user documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/extensions.html).

The beta releases are suitable for general
usage. For JupyterLab extension developers, the extension APIs will continue to
evolve until the 1.0 release.
