They come in two forms: the *input cell* where the user types the code to be executed, and the *output cell* which is the representation of the executed code. Depending on the code, this representation may be a simple scalar value, or something more complex like a plot or an interactive widget. Tab completion (**`Tab`**) and a tool tip feature (**`Shift Tab`**) are supported.\n",

Most importantly, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts for efficiently performing notebook and cell actions. For example, pressing **`c`** when in command mode, will copy the current cell; no modifier is needed.\n",

    "The first concept to understand in mouse-based navigation is that **cells can be selected by clicking on them.** The currently selected cell is indicated with a blue bar on its left. Clicking inside a cell's editor area will enter edit mode. Clicking on the prompt or the output area of a cell will enter command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second concept to understand in mouse-based navigation is that **cell actions usually apply to the currently selected cell**. For example, to run the code in a cell, select it and then click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-play icon-play\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the **`Cell -> Run`** menu item. Similarly, to copy a cell, select it and then click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-copy icon-copy\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the **`Edit -> Copy`** menu item. With this simple pattern, it should be possible to perform nearly every action with the mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells have one other state which can be modified with the mouse. These cells can either be rendered or unrendered. When they are rendered, a nice formatted representation of the cell's contents will be presented. When they are unrendered, the raw text source of the cell will be presented. To render the selected cell with the mouse, click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-play icon-play\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the **`Cell -> Run`** menu item. To unrender the selected cell, double click on the cell."

    "The most important keyboard shortcuts are **`Enter`**, which enters edit mode, and **`Esc`**, which enters command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In edit mode, most of the keyboard is dedicated to typing into the cell's editor. Thus, in edit mode there are relatively few shortcuts. In command mode, the entire keyboard is available for shortcuts, so there are many more possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following shortcuts have been found to be the most useful in day-to-day tasks:\n",

    "- Basic navigation: **`enter`**, **`shift-enter`**, **`up/k`**, **`down/j`**\n",
