    "# Setup containerized Jupyter server for Jupyter-JSC\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook will explain how to setup a containerized Jupyter server at Jupyter-JSC. It makes use of the expert features described on page 22 (as of November 25th, 2020) of the training material available [here](https://jupyter-jsc.fz-juelich.de/nbviewer/github/FZJ-JSC/jupyter-jsc-notebooks/blob/master/Jupyter-JSC_supercomputing-in-the-browser.pdf). Please note, that setting up a containerized Jupyter server for the JupyterHub at JSC might introduce certain drawbacks to your Jupyter-JSC experience. Specifically, you will be restricted to the software environment that is installed in your container environment only, which might introduce unwanted side-effects to your JupyterLab-based workflows on the JSC HPC systems. For example, usage of the SLURM batch scheduler commands is not possible, because the SLURM libraries are not visible from the container environment per default. Also, you won't be able to use the Lmod software environment modules provided by JSC. Please note, that if these kind of side-effects are not acceptable, you might rather use a containerized Jupyter kernel as [described here](install-singularity-jupyter-kernel.ipynb). You could also setup your own non-containerized JupyterLab server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, you can switch back to the default Jupyter-JSC server environment anytime by deleting `$HOME/.jupyter/start_jupyter-jsc.sh` after [login to the JSC systems](https://apps.fz-juelich.de/jsc/hps/juwels/access.html) via SSH.\n",

    "* `container` group access for the JSC systems as described [here](https://apps.fz-juelich.de/jsc/hps/juwels/container-runtime.html#getting-access) in the docs\n"
